# Editor Panel

![editor](images/application-nodeeditor.png)

The nodeeditor is made up of two panels, the [properties](properties.md) panel and the [dataflow](dataflow.md) panel. This panel is used to design the system that generates the terrain. Adding, attaching, and running nodes to generate the terrain. The connection between nodes is done through one of two types of data [mono](types.md) or [rgba](types.md).

1. [Properties](properties.md) panel. For editing a selected nodes properties.
2. [Dataflow](dataflow.md) panel. For creating and attaching nodes for the entire generation.
3. A specific node [simplex noise](noise.md) (in this case) that is in the dataflow diagram.
