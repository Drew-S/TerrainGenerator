The editor panel is divided into two components, the properties panel: that can be used to update selected nodes properties; and the dataflow panel: that is used to connect the nodes and create terrain generation.

The dataflow panel is where the terrain generation is done from. The nodes here connect to define the procedure to generate the terrain.
