The preview panel is made up of several information displays and widgets that can be interacted with to alter the preview window.

1. Rotates the **sun** around the terrain (turntable style).
2. Rotates the **sun** over the terrain, from 0 degrees (matching the horizon) to 90 degrees (directly above).
3. Rotates the **camera** over the terrain,  from 0 degrees (matching the horizon) to 90 degrees (directly above).
4. Rotates the **camera** around the terrain (turntable style).
5. Zooms the **camera** in and out of the screen.
6. Indicates the location of the **sun**. The location is the direction only, the sun is rendered as though it is far enough away the rays are parallel.
7. The preview of the **terrain** displays the results of the dataflow generation procedure, the output node must be set.
8. Indicates the rotation of the **camera** relative to the terrain, each of the colors represent an axis in the positive direction (green = y+, red = x+, blue = z+).
