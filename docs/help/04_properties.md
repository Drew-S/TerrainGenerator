![properties](images/application-properties-mask.png)

The **properties** panel is part of the [editor](03_editor.md) panel. This panel is shown when a node is created and has properties that can be edited or a node is double clicked and has properties that can be edited. If the node does not have editable properties this panel is not updated. If a node is deleted this panel is automatically hidden.

The properties that can be displayed in this panel is dependent on the node. See [dataflow](05_dataflow.md) for a list of nodes.
